# Obsidian: Embed All Notes from a Folder

This Obsidian DataviewJS snippet displays the contents of all notes from a specified folder on a single page.

## Requirements
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin in Obsidian
- "Enable JavaScript queries"** option enabled in Dataview settings

## Usage
1. Create a new note **outside** the target folder.
2. Replace `"YOUR_FOLDER"` with the path to your folder (e.g. `"Quotes"`).
3. Paste the code as a `dataviewjs` block.

⚠️ **Do not embed this page inside the same folder** - it will cause a crash!
